# llm-guided-consent-finder

This Python script automates the process of identifying consent screens within an iOS app, taking screenshots of each screen and navigating through them. It leverages Appium for automation and requires a jailbroken iPhone for full access.  

## Prerequisites  

Before running the script, ensure the following requirements are met:  

1. **Jailbroken iPhone** – The script requires root access to interact with the app freely.  
2. **Appium Installed and running in the background on the Machine** – Used for automating interactions with the app.    
3. **Prepare your API KEYs** 

- set your AppStore account email by running this command in the terminal (make sure you set the API KYEs in the same terminal where you run the script in): 
```sh
export AppStore_email="YOUR_AppStore_Email_HERE"
```

- set your AppStore account password by running this command in the terminal (make sure you set the API KYEs in the same terminal where you run the script in): 
```sh
export AppStore_password="YOUR_AppStore_Password_HERE"
```


- set your OpenAI key by running this command in the terminal (make sure you set the API KYEs in the same terminal where you run the script in): 
```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OpenAI_KEY_HERE"
```

- set your Dropbox key by running this command in the terminal:
```sh
export MY_Dropbox_access_key="YOUR_Dropbox_KEY_HERE"
```

## Tested Environments  

- **macOS Sonoma 14.6.1**
